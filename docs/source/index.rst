Open5GS-UI is an extension for Open5GS that provides a web-based interface for
visualizing and managing the Open5GS network. It enables users to scrape data
from different components of the 5G network, analyze network traffic, and monitor
the performance of the network. The scraped data can be displayed in various charts,
tables, and graphs, providing insights into the network's behavior.
